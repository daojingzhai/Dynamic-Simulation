# Dynamic-Simulation
### _Dynamic simulation is the use of a computer program to model the time-varying behavior of a system. In my computational physics course, I studied the application of dynamic simulation in some statistical physics problems._

### Monte Carlo Method
1. Random Walk

A random walk describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers. I simulated 2D random walk via Monte Carlo Method in my [code](https://github.com/daojingzhai/Dynamic-Simulation/tree/master/Monte%20Carlo%20method/Random%20Walk%202D). Following figure shows one possible track.

2. Brownian Motions

Brownian motion is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving molecules in the fluid. The following picture (from [Wikipedia: Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion)) reveals Brownian motion in 2D space.

I simulated 1D Brownian Motion via Monte Carlo Method [[code](https://github.com/daojingzhai/Dynamic-Simulation/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20method/Brownian%20Motions/Brownian_Motions.py)] and this figure shows the particle's position distribution.

3. Diffusion-limited aggregation

Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. I simulated two beautiful patterns via Monte Carlo Method. [[code](https://github.com/daojingzhai/Dynamic-Simulation/tree/master/Monte%20Carlo%20method/DLA)]

### Molecular Dynamics Simulation
- 2D Simple Liquid motion

From statistical physics's view, I simulate the time-varying of a system of 2D simple molecular via Python.
